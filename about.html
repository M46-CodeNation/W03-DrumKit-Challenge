                        <p>This website is a hypothetical proof of concept, for an integration between
                            <em><strong>Virtual Drumming</strong></em>
                            and <em><strong>Iron Maiden</strong></em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The hypothetical scenario being played out is:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <em>
                                I have been contracted by <strong>Virtual Drumming</strong>, to produce a
                                proof-of-concept virtual drumkit,
                                integrated within <strong>Iron Maiden's</strong> official website. The PoC site would be
                                used within a sales pitch
                                to <strong>Iron Maiden</strong>, to provide a mini-game for their website; with the aim
                                of boosting marketing for an
                                upcoming drum Masterclass series, on <strong>Virtual Drumming</strong>, hosted by
                                <strong>Nicko McBrain</strong>.
                            </em>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            To this end, the skeleton framework of the site is heavily based around the design from
                            <a href="https://www.ironmaiden.com" target="_blank">www.ironmaiden.com</a>. Their choice of
                            typography, logos, favicon,
                            background assets, and general page structure have all been retained. This is to ensure that
                            the
                            proof of concept design is as close as possible to the site it would eventually be hosted
                            on.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The virtual drumkit audio, and visual assets, for Nicko's drumkit, have been lifted from
                            <a href="http://www.virtualdrumming.com" target="_blank">www.virtualdrumming.com</a>, and
                            tweaked to fit into a new host
                            container. This is to ensure that the proof of concept mini-game is as close as possible to
                            the
                            original, as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, a full JS framework has been written from scratch to allow multiple ways of
                            interacting
                            with the virtual drumkit.

                            This hypothetical case scenario is solely an educational exercise and does not necessarily
                            reflect the official position of <em><strong>Virtual Drumming</strong></em>,
                            or <em><strong>Iron Maiden</strong></em> on this issue. At time of publication, no such
                            collaborations exist between the two entities, and nothing like this hypothetical scenario
                            has been discussed within the public realm, by either entity. This hypothetical scenario has
                            been imagined for an educational assignment, based around audio-visual control on a website,
                            using JavaScript.
